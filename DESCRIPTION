Description: Automate explanation of machine learning predictive models.
  This package generates advanced interactive and animated model explanations in the form
  of a serverless HTML site. It combines 'R' with 'D3.js' to produce plots and descriptions
  for various local and global explanations. Tools for model exploration unite with
  tools for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to give a broad overview of the model behaviour.
  'modelStudio' is a fast and condensed way to get all the answers without much effort. 
  Break down your model and look into its ingredients with only a few lines of code.
